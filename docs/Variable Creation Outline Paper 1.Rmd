# Process to clean and create variables for paper to analyze land cover change and fuel use

**The following is an outline of steps for creating and attaching variables (assigned to Kate and Varun) to LSMS survey clusters for Malawi**

**Scripts and data may be accessed in GISPractice github**


# MARKET ACCESS 
  (shortest road distance from an IHS cluster to the nearest city, maybe weighted by night time lights)
  
  * **We need to ask Yu about this.  I don't think that this is the correct way to measure distance to markets using the data that we have?**
  * Variable is a distance unit
  

  **2016-2017 Data**
  
  #~~1 Import LSMS (2016-17) spatial data as .csv~~
  
  #~~2 Created LSMS (2016-17) HH location shapefile~~
    
  * Output: /data/mw16_hh_geo_sp_wgs84 (main file to which variables are added)
    + Script: 01_process_lsms-mw-hh-geo-201617.R
  

  #~~3 Download 'Accessibility to cities (2015)' and create accessibility variable~~
  
  * Downloaded as .tif file
  * Extracted value based on points; added as "access_to_city15_nobuff" variable
  * Extracted mean value within 10km buffer; added as "access_to_city15_buff10k" variable
    + Script: 02_extract_accessibilitytoCities_MW1617.R

  
  #4 Night time lights data variable
  
  * Process .tif of night time lights for YEARS ####-####
  * Set threshold of ## as radiance that counts as "market/urban"
  * Repeat step 3 to create variable that corroborates their distance variables
  * Potential to weight based on night time lights?
  
# POPULATION DENSITY

**Within 10 km buffer of LSMS cluster**

  #1 Download and import AfriPop data for YEARS ####
  
  #2 Create density variable using average buffer value
  
  * Sum values for POPULATION of 10 km radius buffer
  * Divide sum by area of buffer (2 * pi * 100 km)
  
  #3 Create density variable by extracting at location for POP DENSITY value (if it exists already)
  
# ELEVATION

  #1 Download and import .tif of DEM
  
  #2 Extract DEM value at location point and create variable
  
# SOIL QUALITY
  
  * Not sure how this is going to be captured nor by which data set- need to ask Yu
  
  
# ACCESS TO WATER 

  * Not sure how this is going to be captured nor by which data set- need to ask Yu


# URBAN (Using Night Time Lights)

  * Not sure how this is going to be captured- need to ask Yu
