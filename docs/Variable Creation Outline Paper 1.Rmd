# Process to clean and create variables for paper to analyze land cover change and fuel use

**The following is an outline of steps for creating and attaching variables to LSMS survey clusters for Malawi (years ??)**
# This outline uses MARKET ACCESS as the example variable


#~~1 Import LSMS (2016-17) spatial data as .csv~~
#~~2 Created LSMS (2016-17) HH location shapefile~~



#2 Import AfriPop data (YEARS) as #### file



#3 Process AfriPop data
  + Create density variable
    ++ Population/Area (sq km)
    ++ Choose threshold to qualify as "market" (e.g., 500 persons/sq km)
    ++ Create binary variable: Market, not market
    ++ Any contiguous area >XX sq km AND market = market (aggregating larger areas to reduce salt and pepper effect)
    
#4 Add 'MARKET ACCESS' variable to LSMS clusters
 + Create variable column: 'MARKET ACCESS', values {yes, no}
 + Search for geographically proximal markets to each cluster 
 # Offset radius of LSMS clusters = XX km. 
 + IF determined 'market' (from step 3) falls within 2*'offset radius', THEN LSMS cluster = "yes" for 'MARKET ACCESS'
